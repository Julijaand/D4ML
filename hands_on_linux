https://rit.accenture.com/batc-confluence/display/DI/AWS+Instance+creation+steps 

users
whoami – view user
sudo su – change user to root to create new user
adduser admin – create admin user
*in my case user admin was already existing with passwords, so I had to reset psw with command:
sudo passwd -d admin
I have also checked privileges of existing admin and added ALL privileges with command
visudo
sudo shown admin:sudo . – added admin user in sudo group
sudo adduser director – add user director
sudo addgroup maintenance – add group maintenance

archive
after user changed to admin:
cd /etc/nginx/ - go to nginx directory
tar -czf compressed.tar.gz /etc/nginx/ - create archive from /etc/nginx/* directory
tar -tf compressed.tar.gz - shows what in compressed folder
cd /opt – move to opt directory
mkdir archive – create archive directory
cd /etc/nginx/ - move to nginx directory
mv compressed.tar.gz  opt/archive - moves archives folder to opt/archive
chown director archive – changes owner to director
chown :maintenance archive – changes group to maintenance
it is also possible to change permissions for archive folder for user/group/others:
chmod 754 archive

create output.txt file with executed commands
cd /opt/archive
vim output.txt
